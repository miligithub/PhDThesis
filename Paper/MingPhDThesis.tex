\begin{abstract}
The technological advancements have made smartphones an indispensable component of our daily lives. The security and privacy (S\&P) on smartphones has thus become an important research topic. 
Since there are no universally applicable solutions to solve S\&P issues on smartphones, we conduct our research in a case study manner, with a focus on smartphone sensors. 
%
We propose {\spp} to show how smartphones get eavesdropped  by motion sensors, {\uu} to authenticate users with gestures in the air, and {\mv} to protect voice authentication system against spoofing attacks.

%
In detail, {\systemName} system turns smartphones into spy bugs by performing {\attackName} attack.  Such attack is  based on the fact that motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) can measure audio signals, though at a much lower sampling rate. It is a big threat to smartphone users since the phone's operating system grants applications permissions to motion sensors automatically.
 %
 
{\uu} uses the microphones and speakers in smartphones to send ultrasound signals and catch user’s finger movements, then utilizes these user-specific movements to unlock the phone. It is a great alternative to the password/fingerprint authentication when users' fingers are dirty or wet and to the face authentication when users wear masks or goggles.
%


 {\shortname} is a spoof-proof voice authentication system which not only authenticates users by their voices but also differentiates live people and electronic devices. In other words, attackers are unable to unlock the phone by replay attack (attackers record the victim's voice in person or online, then replay the recording and access the victim's devices illegally). The idea is to utilize the self demodulation effect and acoustic attenuation effect when sound signals transmit through human bodies. Motion sensors are used to catch such signals.

%%%============Acknowledgements==============
%% Comment the section out if you don't need it 
%\begin{acknowledgment}
%%	This optional page includes a paragraph or two acknowledging and thanking your
%%	advisor(s), committee members, funding sponsors, family members etc.
%%			
%%	Typically, if you acknowledge everyone here, you won’t have a dedication page.
%	Thank you, advisor, committee members,friends, family members etc.
%\end{acknowledgment}

%%==================Dedication===============
% Comment the section out if you don't need it 
%\begin{dedication}
%	Dedication Page: A dedication page is optional and not frequently included in a thesis. However, occasionally the thesis writer wants to dedicate the document to a professional colleague, friend, or relative. A dedication typically expresses gratitude for someone's support. If a dedication page is included, it is placed at the end of the front matter section, following the acknowledgments. Typically, a dedication page has no title, it simply states, e.g., "For my father." Roman numeral page numbering continues on the dedication page.
