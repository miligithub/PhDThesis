\chapter{{\mv}: A Spoof-proof Voice Authentication System for Smartphones}

	Voice authentication is drawing increasing attention and becomes an attractive alternative to passwords for mobile authentication. However, existing voice authentication systems are vulnerable to various spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can record the victim's voice in person or online, then replay the recording and access the victim's devices illegally. 
We propose \shortname, a spoof-proof voice authentication system which not only differentiate different people but also differentiate live people and electronic devices. The idea is to utilize the self demodulation effect and acoustic attenuation effect when sound signals transmit through human bodies. Our system can defend the smartphone's voice authentication system against 3 attack scenarios, each contains 3 attack types. Experiments show  {\shortname} can identify different users with 94.33\% accuracy and defend voice spoofing attacks with at least 93.67\% accuracy.
