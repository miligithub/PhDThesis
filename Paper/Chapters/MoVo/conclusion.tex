\section{conclusion}

Self demodulation and acoustic attenuation can be used to build {\shortname}, a spoof-proof voice authentication system. When a user speaks with the smartphone placed on his throat, his voice not only influences the microphone readings, but also affects the accelerometer and gyroscopes. By adopting a sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory network, syllable separation and majority voting, \shortname~can defend against 3 different types of attacks at least 93.67\% defend rate and a 94.33\% acceptance rate for legitimate users.
