\chapter{{\spp}: Eavesdropping on Smartphone Speakers\protect \\ with Motion Sensors}

We introduce the \textit{{\attackName}} attack, which can turn smartphones into spy bugs. This attack is based on the fact that motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) can measure audio signals, though at a much lower sampling rate. This attack imposes a big threat to smartphone users since the phone's operating system grant applications permission to motion sensors automatically. Compared to prior works, the {\attackName} attack focuses on the \textit{intra-device} scenario, where motion sensors eavesdrop on the same phone's built-in speakers. With compressed sensing theories and machine learning techniques, we implement the attack in an eavesdropping system called {\textit{\systemName}}, which is able to filch various critical information from smartphone users. Experiment results show that {\systemName} can learn user activity, speaker gender, speaker identity, and speech content with an average accuracy of 81\%, 93\%, 98\%, and up to 90\%, respectively. Apart from the good accuracy, the most significant contribution of this work is that the {\systemName} system is \textit{speaker-independent}. Unlike previous related works which need specific training data from the victim, {\systemName} is trained just once on public speech dataset and can filch critical information from brand new victims.
