\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduced the {\attackName} attack and implemented it in the {\systemName} system.  This  {\systemName} system achieves user-independent attacking by compressed sensing and long short-time memory networks. The average accuracies for classifying user activity, speaker gender, speaker identity, and speech content are 81\%, 93\%, 98\%, and up to 90\%, respectively. Future work is to improve the robustness of {\systemName} by adding more training data collected in noisy environment and in moving state, and by extending the vocabulary.
