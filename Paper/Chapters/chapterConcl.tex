\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:concl}
In this thesis, we studied three privacy and security problems on smartphones.
We first uncovered a new stealth attack named the {\attackName} attack that eavesdrops on smartphones' built-in speakers by the intra-device motion sensors. The attack is implemented in {\spp} system utilizing speaker-independent machine learning, which makes the attack more dangerous and harmful. We also provided hardware-based defenses and software-based defenses for this attack, but this attack is still a threat for smartphone users and requires user awareness. We then introduced two different authentication methods. The {\uu} system enables users to unlock the smartphone with gestures in the air.  It is a good alternative to existing authentication methods. Moreover, the same technique can be used for smartphone control, which allows users to unlock and control the phone without touching the screen.  The {\mv} system is a patch for current voice authentication mechanism. It defends smartphones against various voice-spoofing attacks, especially the replay attack. The three systems either propose new S\&P problem on smartphones, or solve existing S\&P problems with novel approaches. However, we have also noticed the limitations of the current work and will continue improve it in future work.

%. First, we focused on privacy issues in crowdsensing, which is about the safeguarding of users. We identified the privacy problems in task allocation and incentive mechanisms raised by inference attack. To preserve users’ location privacy during task allocation, we proposed two task allocation algorithms which maximize the number of assigned tasks while providing personalized loca- tion privacy protection against location-inference attack in Chapter 3. To protect users’ bid privacy in incentive mechanisms, we designed two frameworks for privacy-preserving auction- based incentive mechanisms in Chapter 4. Next, we shifted our focus to security issues in crowdsensing, which is about the safeguarding of the system. Specifically, we identified the security problems in incentive mechanisms and truth discovery raised by Sybil attack. To deter users conducting Sybil attack in incentive mechanisms, we designed Sybil-proof incen- tive mechanisms for both offline and online scenarios in Chapter 5. To diminish the impact of Sybil attack on the aggregated data, we proposed a Sybil-resistant truth discovery frame- work in Chapter 6. The major novelty and contribution of this thesis lie in two parts. The first part is identifying privacy and security issues in crowdsensing. Although many works aim to improve the performance of crowdsensing systems, the potential privacy and security issues might undermine crowdsensing. In this thesis, we identified privacy and security issues in there parts in crowdsensing: task allocation, incentive mechanisms, and truth discovery. Pointing out these issues provides new aspects to evaluate the vulnerability of crowdsensing. The second part is solving the identified privacy and security issues. Solving privacy and security issues is much harder than identifying them. Sometimes it is impossible to fully eliminate the impact of an attack. For each of the aforementioned issues, we proposed cor-
